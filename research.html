            <p>To create a healthy environment for the regeneration of periodontal ligament and/or bone around teeth and implants, myriad factors must be addressed. This research details how the surface characteristics chemistry and roughness can affect cell response and local factor production. Providing insight into regeneration at the site of a bony defect, it appears that the surface characteristics of an implant may direct tissue healing and, therefore, result in subsequent implant success by modulating osteoblast phenotypic expression.</p>

                <p>Most cases of craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of cranial sutures, require surgical reconstruction. In post-operative craniosynostosis patients, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitors may be used to prevent rapid bone regrowth, known as re-synostosis. However, this therapy still requires the development of a delivery vehicle to localize release at the administration site. Here, we offer an in situ rapidly crosslinking injectable hydrogel. In addition to craniofacial applications, this hydrogel can potentially provide customizable protein, small molecule, and cell delivery to any site accessible via needle or catheter.</p>

                <p>While microencapsulating stem cells in injectable microbeads can enhance delivery and localization, their ability to initiate growth factor production is still unknown. Growth factor mRNA levels and production from alginate microbeads with encapsulated human adipose stem cells (ASC microbeads) cultured in both growth and chondrogenic media were measured over a two-week period. Microencapsulation was found to enhance chondrogenic growth factor production. It was also shown that chrondrogenic medium treatment can decrease angiogenic growth factor production from ASCs, making these cells a potential source for paracrine factors that can stimulate cartilage regeneration. </p>

                <p>1α,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] acts on cells through traditional steroid hormone receptor-mediate gene transcription and by initiating rapid membrane-associate signaling pathways. Two receptors have been implicated in rapid signaling by 1,25(OH)2D3, vitamin D receptor (VDR) and disulfide isomerase. To investigate the roles of these two receptors, our lab has established tools including gene knock-out, conditional knock-out, silencing and over-expression in various model systems such as growth plate chondrocytes and extracellular matrix vesicles. Using these models we have demonstrated that Pdia3-dependent signaling in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates growth plate physiology. </p>

                <p>17β-estradiol can promote the growth and development of several estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancers. ERα36 has been shown to mediate rapid, non-genomic, membrane-associated effects of 17β-estradiol in several cancer cell lines, including triple negative HCC38 breast cancer cells and producing an anti-apoptotic effect. This study provides a working model for a mechanism by which estradiol promotes anti-apoptosis through membrane-associate ERα36, suggesting that ERα36 may be a potential membrane target for drug design against breast cancer, particularly triple negative breast cancer. </p>

                <p>Post-menopausal women have lower serum 25(OH)D3 metabolism, and sex may be a risk factor in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Vitamin D is known for its role in bone metabolism, and evidence suggests that vitamin D metabolites mediate inflammation and cartilage remodeling. This study finds that sex differences exist in 25(OH)D3 Vitamin D3 metabolites, which suggests that vitamin D modulation may contribute to the sex differences seen in the severity and development of knee OA. </p>

                <p>The secosteroid 1α,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 acts on cells via classical steroid hormone receptor-mediated gene transcription and by initiating rapid membrane-mediated signaling pathways. Across pathways in the cell’s membrane, these secosteriods interact with protein disulfide isomerase and activate protein kinase C. Recent efforts to determine the signaling proteins in this process have indicated that phospholipase A2 activating protein and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II are required. </p>

                <p>Muscle trauma is one of the leading causes of injury in the United States, and can
                    result in severe functional deficits. Despite the prevalence of these injuries, there are
                    still no effective treatments that regenerate new, functional skeletal muscle. We have
                    developed a decellularized muscle graft that retains chemical and physical cues
                    needed to stimulate new muscle fiber growth. Our research addresses key questions
                    that investigate how these grafts regulate myoblast phenotype toward a mature
                    fusion-competent cell capable of forming new muscle fibers.</p>

                <p>Age-related decline in skeletal muscle function limits mobility and patient quality of
                    life, and is a contributing factor to increased fall risks in older individuals. With the
                    number of individuals over the age of 65 to double in the next 20 years, it is
                    imperative to develop a clear understanding of the effects of aging on muscle
                    homeostasis, repair, and regeneration. Muscle homeostasis and regeneration are
                    regulated by a subpopulation of muscle progenitor cells called myoblasts. However,
                    as muscle ages, myoblast function declines. This decline has been associated with
                    increased collagen synthesis, possibly linking myoblast function with extracellular
                    matrix-mediated signaling. Our goal is to study the impact of aged extracellular
                    matrix on myoblast phenotype and myofiber function.</p>

                <p>Myoblast fusion into a multinucleated syncytium is a well-controlled regenerative
                    process that requires cell-cell adhesion and communication. Unlike de novo muscle
                    formation during embryonic development, new muscle fiber formation in adults
                    involves a host of signaling molecules that activates muscle progenitor cells,
                    regulates their differentiation, and promotes fusion. This process occurs naturally
                    following mild injuries, but is impaired after a severe injury, suggesting the signaling
                    pathways, which promote fusion and regeneration, are affected. Understanding
                    these signaling modalities that regulate myoblast fusion and fiber formation are
                    fundamental to understanding muscle regeneration.</p>
